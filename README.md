*To be used with the [Armer Driver](https://github.com/qcr/armer)*

This package launches the Mico drivers for use with the [Armer Driver](https://github.com/qcr/armer).

It interfaces with the [Mico drivers](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-ros/tree/noetic-devel) so they must be installed and built as well.
